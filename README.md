# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions implemented in Java.

## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are essential concepts in computer science that help in solving complex problems efficiently. This repository aims to provide solutions to common DSA questions in Java.

## Contents

1. **Arrays**
    - Array rotation
    - Find maximum subarray sum
    - ...

2. **Linked Lists**
    - Implementing a singly linked list
    - Detecting cycles in a linked list
    - ...

3. **Stacks and Queues**
    - Implementing a stack using arrays
    - Implementing a queue using linked lists
    - ...

4. **Trees**
    - Binary search tree operations (insertion, deletion, searching)
    - Tree traversal algorithms (inorder, preorder, postorder)
    - ...

5. **Graphs** Coming soon
    - Depth-first search (DFS)
    - Breadth-first search (BFS)
    - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)
    - ...

## Usage

Each data structure or algorithm solution is implemented in its own Java class file. To use the solutions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired directory containing the solution.
3. Compile the Java file using `javac filename.java`.
4. Run the compiled class file using `java filename`.
